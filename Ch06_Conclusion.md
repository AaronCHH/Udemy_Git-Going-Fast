#### [GitHub Ultimate: Master Git and GitHub - Beginner to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/github-ultimate/?couponCode=PC_STUDENTS): only $15 \(50% off\)

My newest course is called [GitHub Ultimate: Master Git and GitHub](https://www.udemy.com/github-ultimate/?couponCode=PC_STUDENTS) and it covers both Git and GitHub, but mainly focuses on the many features offered by the GitHub service. This comprehensive course will give anyone using Git an excellent head-start using the most popular Git hosting provider available. In my other courses on Git, I focus on Git and use GitHub simply to host Git repositories. This course really covers GitHub in-depth on its own -- including several features not directly related to Git or source control.

Here are some of the critical skills anyone using GitHub should know:

* Basic and Advanced Git source control
* Create and manage repositories on GitHub
* Associate local Git repositories with GitHub
* Create local copies \(clone\)
* Perform file and folder operations directly on GitHub
* Tracking defects or enhancements with Issues
* Sharing bits of code with Gists
* How Tags and Releases work on GitHub
* Group related repositories with Organizations
* Many others!

The course is about 6 hours long, which the first two hours are focused on Git, the next three are GitHub and the final hour is bonus content. And that's not all, I'm adding to this course over the next few months with other GitHub related topics like large file support and GitHub for Windows client -- I'll send out a course announcement when those sections are ready.
